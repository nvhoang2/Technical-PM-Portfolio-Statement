# Technical-PM-Portfolio-Statement

Thank you for the opportunity. I understand the requirement for a Git repository link.

**Reason for Placeholder:** I have created this repository as a placeholder because the form requires a URL-formatted mandatory field. All of the code I have previously written is proprietary and non-shareable due to past employment agreements.

**My Experience:** I want to assure you that I have a strong development background and have successfully delivered numerous projects as a developer.

**Next Step:** I would be happy to discuss my most challenging technical contributions in detail during the interview.
